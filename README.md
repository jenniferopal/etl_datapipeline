## ETL Pipeline using Autism Dataset

Project Theme: 

Building an ETL Pipeline to clean, transform and analyse the autism screening dataset. The final output will include: 
 - A cleaned and enriched dataset
 - Basic insights visualised (e.g.trends in autism spectrum disorder likelihood based on demographics.)
 - Actionable results displayed (e.g. top features influencing ASD classification.)
